# 😂 Weird Register

Welcome to **Weird Register** – the only registration form that cares so much about your password, it won’t let you use the same one as anyone else! (Yes, even if you’re just trying to be funny.)

## What is this?
A playful web app where you can:
- Register with your email and a password (but your password must be unique across all users!)
- Get sassy error messages if you try to reuse a password
- Enjoy a modern, beautiful UI that’s friendlier than your average login page

## Features
- **FastAPI** backend (Python) for handling registration and login
- **SQLite** database for storing users (and their oh-so-unique passwords)
- **SQLAlchemy** ORM for database magic
- **Passlib** for password hashing (we don’t store your password in plain text, we’re not monsters)
- **Vanilla JS** frontend with a stylish registration form
- **CORS** enabled so you can run frontend and backend separately

## How to Run This Weird Thing

### 1. Backend (API)
1. Go to the `server/` directory:
   ```sh
   cd server
   ```
2. Install dependencies (Python 3.10+ recommended):
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```sh
   uvicorn app:app
   ```

### 2. Frontend (HTML/JS)
Just open `index.html` in your browser. That’s it. No build tools, no nonsense.

## How Does It Work?
- Enter your email and a password (at least 6 characters!)
- If your email is already used, you’ll get a warning
- If your password is already used by someone else, you’ll get a *very* specific warning
- If all is well, you’re registered! 🎉

## Why?
Because normal registration forms are boring. And because you should never reuse passwords (seriously).
